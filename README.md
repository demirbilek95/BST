# Binary Search Tree

An implementation of Binary Search Tree data structure with C++

Group members: Eros Fabrici, Dogan Can Demirbilek, Alessandro Scardoni

##Structure of Repository

* `include` which contains the `node.hxx` (implementation of class node), `iterator.hxx` (implementation of iterator class) and `bst.hxx` (implementation of binary search tree and member functions)

* `src` which contains `test.cpp` (test of bst member functions and constructors), `benchmark.cpp` (benchmark of unbalanced, balanced tree and `std::map`)

* `benchmark` which contains python scripts to plot benchmark results

`Makefile` is used to compile the codes inside `src` folder. By typing `make` in terminal, you will have `test.o` and `benchmark.o`

`Report.pdf` contains the brief explanation of our work, classes, methods and benchmark results.
